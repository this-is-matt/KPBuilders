        <h2>Utah Construction You Can Trust</h2>
        <p>
          KP Builders brings decades of excellence to construction projects in
          and around Northern Utah. Our founder, Kenny Palmer, started his building career while still in high school.
          Since then, he has earned a reputation for being trustworthy and respectful in all his ventures.<br><br>

          Since learning to build new homes and additions early in his career,
          Kenny has focused on various aspects of the construction trade,
          including framing, concrete, finish carpentry, outdoor signage and
          additions. Kenny takes the lead on each project to get it done right
          the first time. That means meeting your expectations, staying within
          your budget, and ensuring that all the legal details and permits are in
          place.
          <br><br>

          Often, KP Builders hires subcontractors to help us complete jobs efficiently. As a fully licensed and insured
          construction
          management team, we do the research, analyze bids, vet company
          reputations and manage timelines to provide an end result you will
          love.

          <h3>Positive Communication</h3>
          <p>‚ÄúKenny redid our deck and patio last summer, 2019. It was a positive experience from start to finish. He
            communicated with us on every step to be sure things were done the way we wanted. The final price ended up
            being a bit less than the quote because of a change we made that ended up using less materials. He was very
            professional and made sure everything was done to code. He arranged the inspection with the city, and it
            passed without a hitch. The deck itself feels so strong and looks great. We are loving our new outdoor
            living space!‚Äù</p>

            addition ourselves, but when it came to the concrete, it was very intimidating. We asked Kenny for help and
            he was able to work out his schedule to help us meet ours. He helped getting the area prepared. His work was
            very professional and we are very pleased with the final results.‚Äù</p>
