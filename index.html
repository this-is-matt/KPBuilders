      <h2>Utah Construction You Can Trust</h2>
      <p>
        KP Builders brings decades of excellence to construction projects in
        and around Northern Utah, from Ogden to Brigham City to Layton. Our
        founder, Kenny Palmer, started his building career while still in high
        school. Since then, he has earned a reputation for being trustworthy
        and respectful in all his ventures.<br />

        Since learning to build new homes and additions early in his career,
        Kenny has focused on various aspects of the construction trade,
        including framing and concrete, finish carpentry, outdoor signage and
        additions. Kenny takes the lead on each project to get it done right
        the first time. That means meeting your expectations, staying within
        your budget and ensuring that all the legal details and permits are in
        place.
        <br />

        Often, KP Builders hires subcontractors to help us complete jobs on
        time and on budget. As a fully licensed and insured construction
        management team, we do the research, analyze bids, vet company
        reputations and manage timelines to provide an end result you will
        love.

          <p>“Kenny redid our deck and patio last summer, 2019. It was a positive experience from start to finish. He
            communicated with us on every step to be sure things were done the way we wanted. The final price ended up
            being a bit less than the quote because of a change we made that ended up using less materials. He was very
            professional and made sure everything was done to code. He arranged the inspection with the city, and it
            passed without a hitch. The deck itself feels so strong and looks great. We are loving our new outdoor
            living space!”</p>

          <p>“Kenny was great. He did the cement floor of our home addition. We were trying to do as much of our
            addition ourselves but when it came to the flat work of the cement, it was very intimidating. We asked Kenny
            for help and he was able to work out his schedule to help us meet ours. He helped getting the area prepared.
            His work was very professional and we are very pleased with the final results.”</p>
